Translational or applied research is research done in order to benefit a population outside of the purely academic “ivory tower”.  For example, translational research might involve testing a new clinical psychology intervention on an inpatient population, experimenting with a new classroom discussion format meant to enhance student engagement, or even mechanistic laboratory research used in the creation of new therapies. 

This past year, I worked on a helpline at National Alliance on Mental Illness, where I began to understand the needs of those suffering from mental illness and discovered just how difficult it is for them to access effective resources.  I recall hearing their stories of hardship beyond what I could even imagine – a formerly wealthy and powerful alcoholic, who after surgery, was unable to walk or to drive himself, and didn’t have enough money to spend on cabs to get to support groups; a mother whose homeless, suicidal daughter stole to support her boyfriend’s drug addiction; a lonely caregiver who could not leave his 91-year-old mother suffering from Alzheimer’s, even for a few hours.  These stories show me, over and over, just how much unmanaged mental illness inhibits essential everyday activities.

These stories show me just how necessary it is to fund and perform research in service of those in need. 
Translational research is most probably the best way to discover how to fill the needs of such populations. 

Unfortunately, this sort of research is done comparatively quite infrequently.  If it is potentially so helpful to the world to perform translational research, then why is it so unusual in academia?  Translational research is often more difficult to design and get approved than non-translational research, as it involves more complex systems of individuals, organizations, and scientific measures.  Because it is performed in more “real-world” settings, translational research contains more confounds than carefully-controlled laboratory research.  In psychology research, for example, translational research, unlike more traditional laboratory research, often involves patient populations with co-morbid diagnoses.  Therefore, it is less likely to be seen as “valid” science, even when it is much more applicable to a “real-world” setting than scientific research in which as many confounds as possible are eliminated. 

Translational research is difficult, but it is important and necessary.
