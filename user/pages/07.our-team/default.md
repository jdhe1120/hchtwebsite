Jennifer is a junior studying Neurobiology, and lives in Dunster House. She is originally from Beijing, China, and currently resides in Arizona. She is specifically interested in mental health in regards to body/self image. Through Harvard College Healing Thoughts, she hopes to relay the importance of mental health to others, and learn about pertinent mental health topics in our society. In her spare time, she enjoys reading aesthetic study blogs and learning Korean.

Hi, I’m Mingu Kim, and I’m a junior in Leverett House studying Applied Mathematics with a focus in biology. I’m from Columbia, Missouri, and I’ve been interested in both the biological basis and the social factors that impact mental health. In my spare time, I enjoy coding, playing violin, and hanging out with friends.

My name is EJ, and I am a current sophomore hailing from Seoul, South Korea. Having grown up in a culture where mental health issues were prevalent yet seldom addressed, I have always wanted to contribute to the dialogue around mental illnesses, both from as a neurobiology concentrator from the biological perspective and from a more holistic, culture perspective.

I’m Katherine Miclau and I’m a current freshman interested in studying neurobiology. I am from San Francisco, CA, and I’m interested in merging academia and clinical research to better understand and destigmatize several prevalent mental health issues. In particular, I’m most focused on bridging the gaps between the biological, social and psychological research on these global health issues. Outside of my academic pursuits, I love sports (particularly diving), watching theater performances, and playing board games!

I am very excited to be secretary for Harvard College Healing Thoughts — HCHT is such a welcoming and passionate group, and I feel lucky to be a part of it! I live near Princeton, NJ, and am a potential concentrator in History and Science, Mind Brain & Behavior track, with a minor in Psychology. My goal is to study the metal health system and its impact on patients, and to serve in my professional life as a patient advocate and educator. Outside of HCHT, I sing Soprano in Radcliffe Choral Society, work as a citizenship tutor, and act as a Student Mental Health Liaison.

I am a sophomore undergraduate, and over the past year, I came to realize how exciting the current state that science is in. I have always loved and appreciated all forms of science, and at college I was able to see how far we know about ourselves and the universe but also how much we still do not know. In fields where such topics can get very intense and vocabulary-heavy, I feel like it is necessary to report and digest this information so that people who are not in the field can still understand the knowledge.

I’m a freshman in Canaday interested in computer science and economics. I’m very excited to be part of the HCHT team and hope to learn from and contribute to the research in mental health. In my free time, I play basketball, chess, and violin.
