                    <p>Hi, I’m Mingu Kim, and I’m a junior in Leverett House studying Applied Mathematics with a focus in biology. I’m from Columbia, Missouri, and I’ve been interested in both the biological basis and the social factors that impact mental health. In my spare time, I enjoy coding, playing violin, and hanging out with friends.</p>

                    <p>My name is EJ, and I am a current sophomore hailing from Seoul, South Korea. Having grown up in a culture where mental health issues were prevalent yet seldom addressed, I have always wanted to contribute to the dialogue around mental illnesses, both from as a neurobiology concentrator from the biological perspective and from a more holistic, culture perspective.</p>

                    <p>I am from San Francisco, CA, and I’m interested in merging academia and clinical research to better understand and destigmatize several prevalent mental health issues. In particular, I’m most focused on bridging the gaps between the biological, social and psychological research on these global health issues. Outside of my academic pursuits, I love sports (particularly diving), watching theater performances, and playing board games!</p>

                    <p>Over the past year, I came to realize how exciting the current state that science is in. I have always loved and appreciated all forms of science, and at college I was able to see how far we know about ourselves and the universe but also how much we still do not know. In fields where such topics can get very intense and vocabulary-heavy, I feel like it is necessary to report and digest this information so that people who are not in the field can still understand the knowledge.</p>
